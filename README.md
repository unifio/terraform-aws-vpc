# Terraform AWS VPC Stack #
[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/unifio/terraform-aws-vpc/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/unifio/terraform-aws-vpc/tree/master)

Terraform module for deployment and management of an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and related resources.

This module is well suited to both basic and advanced use cases with very few required inputs, but the ability to configure just about every feature available.

## Requirements ##

- Terraform 0.12.0 or newer
- AWS provider

## Quick Start

The following code will yield a fully functioning VPC environment:

```js
module "vpc_base" {
  source = "github.com/unifio/terraform-aws-vpc?ref=master//base"
}

module "az" {
  source = "github.com/unifio/terraform-aws-vpc?ref=master//az"

  vpc_id = "${module.vpc_base.vpc_id}"
}
```

## Base Module ##

The Base module provisions the VPC, Internet Gateway and DMZ routing table. It additionally enables flow log capture over the entire VPC.

### Input Variables ###

Name | Type | Required | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`enable_classiclink` | string | Default: `false` | Specifies whether ClassicLink is enabled for the VPC.
`enable_dns` | string | Default: `true` | Specifies whether DNS resolution is supported for the VPC.
`enable_hostnames` | string | Default: `false` | Specifies whether the instances launched in the VPC get DNS hostnames.
`flow_log_traffic_type` | string | Default: `ALL` | The type of traffic to capture. Valid values: ACCEPT,REJECT,ALL.
`instance_tenancy` | string | Default: `default` | The allowed tenancy of instances launched into the VPC. Other options at this time are `dedicated` and `host`. These will both force any instance launched into the VPC to be dedicated, regardless of the tenancy option specified when the instance is launched. See [EC2 Dedicated Instance Doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-instance.html) for more information.
`stack_item_label` | string | Default: `qckstrt` | Short form identifier for this stack. This value is used to create the "Name" tag for resources created by this stack item, and also serves as a unique key for re-use.
`stack_item_fullname` | string | Default: `VPC Quick Start` | Long form descriptive name for this stack item. This value is used to create the "application" tag for resources created by this stack item.
`vpc_cidr` | string | Default: `172.16.0.0/21` | The CIDR block you want the VPC to cover.
`vgw_ids` | string | | A list of virtual gateways to associate with the routing tables for route propagation.

### Usage ###

```js
module "vpc_base" {
  source = "github.com/unifio/terraform-aws-vpc?ref=master//base"

  enable_dns          = "true"
  enable_hostnames    = "false"
