#### BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:
* Terraform versions earlier than 0.12.0 no longer supported.

## 0.3.6 (Jul 11, 2018)

#### BUG FIXES:
* Resolved [issue](https://github.com/unifio/terraform-aws-vpc/issues/32) caused by [terraform-provider-aws v1.25.0](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues/2514). Addressed by adding a default `instance_tenancy` when one isn't supplied using a local variable.

## 0.3.5 (March 11, 2018)

#### IMPROVEMENTS / NEW FEATURES:
* Updated CI configuration to more reliably handle Terraform / AWS timing issues.
* Added security group rule descriptions.

#### BUG FIXES:
* Updated az module to properly handle 0 private subnets.

## 0.3.4 (March 7, 2018)

#### BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:
* Terraform versions earlier than 0.11.0 no longer supported.
* The following input variable have been changed:
  * az module
    * `dmz_cidrs` -> `dmz_cidrs_override`
    * `lan_cidrs` -> `lan_cidrs_override`

* Updated DHCP module outputs to suppress warnings in Terraform 0.11.0+

## 0.3.3 (November 13, 2017)

#### IMPROVEMENTS / NEW FEATURES:
* Add 'enable' flag for DHCP.  Default is true.  This allows for stacks to include these based on variable since at this time you cannot conditionally include modules.
